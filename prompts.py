FAQ
Q: What brewers will the Capsules work in?
A: These refillable reusable espresso capsules can be used with compatible brewers: Essenza, Citiz, Pixie, U, and Lattissima and other brewers (except brewers with one pin: F897, F896, F893). For pre-October 2010 brewers, simply remove the red silicone ring. Note: This product will not work with Dolce Gusto® Brewers, Tassimo® Brewers, Keurig® Brewers, or any other brand.
Q: How many times can the capsule be reused?
A: You should be able to reuse them over 30 times maybe as many as 100 times. It really depends on how careful you are with the capsule. It is pretty durable.
Q: What is the capsule made out of?
A: My-Cap capsule is made of food-safe polypropylene. There are two (top and bottom) 304 stainless steel screens used to filter out the coffee grounds. In addition, there is an o-ring made of out silicone rubber used with later model brewers.
Q: What about BPA?
A: Our products are BPA free. All of our products use an FDA approved material.
Q: Why would I want more than 1?"
A: True, you could get by on just one capsule. However, the reason most people buy the single-serve brewers is because of the convenience. If you buy just one then you have to always be rinsing a capsule out and making one before making your brew. If you buy more than one capsule then you can make up a bunch of them in advance and then just use them like you would with a regular capsule.
Q: Why use the reusable capsule?
A: The primary reason is cost. Reusing our capsule reduces your cost per cup significantly. In addition, you will help the environment by not using as many capsules.
Q: What coffee grind should I use?
A: Make sure you are using a good coffee, preferably something with a bold strong taste. The grind MUST be an espresso grind. If you try and use regular coffee in the capsule it will come out weak.
Q: Is this product dishwasher safe?
A: Yes. It should be fine.

Link 
https://www.my-cap.com/products/my-caps-silicone-cap-and-lid-to-reuse-capsules-for-nespresso-vertuoplus-brewers
Price
$11.99
Description
The My-Cap Reusable cap and lid allows you to fill your own capsules. Fill with your favorite espresso or coffee and reuse the silicone cap and lid indefinitely. This lowers the cost to brew each cup and also gives you an excellent espresso or coffee each time. In addition, you will be reducing environmental impact. Each time you reuse a capsule, you reduce the cost even more on a per-cup basis. The more you use them, the more cost-effective it is.

Features
INCLUDES:  Food grade reusable silicone cap and lid, 20 filters, and instructions.
SOLUTION:  Brew your favorite espresso or coffee with your preferred capsule. Make many capsules in advance for storing and keep them fresh using the lids. This is the lowest cost and most flexible per brew solution on the market.
IT WORKS:  Makes beautiful crema! Enjoy your favorite coffee drink:  espresso, latte, cappuccino, and coffee. Recommended for all manual and automatic closing brewers.
SAFE & GREEN:  Food-safe materials, and BPA & BPS free, reduced environmental impact.


Instructions
Prepare the capsule for reuse by removing the foil with a sharp cutting tool. Wash, rinse, and dry before using.
Fill an empty capsule with coffee of choice to the foil line. Tamp lightly, while ensuring to not pack too tightly.
The silicone cap may be used with or without a filter (personal preference).
To use without a filter, place a cap on top of the lightly tamped coffee.
To use with a filter, place filter on the coffee, then carefully press the cap onto the filter, ensuring cap and filter are secure and even with the foil line.
To prepare capsules for future use, follow filling instructions, then place a silicone lid on the capsule for an airtight seal.
Store and use as needed.
When ready to brew, remove the lid and place the capsule with cap in the brewer.


FAQ
Q: How many times can the silicone cap and lid be reused? A: If you are careful with it, indefinitely. 
Q: What is the black round object in the picture holding the capsule? A: It is a capsule holder base. The bottom of the capsules is round which makes them hard to fill unless something holds the capsule still. This holder is available separately. 
Q: Does this product contain BPA? A: This product is food grade silicone and does not contain BPA and is also free of BPS, PVC, lead, latex, phthalates, nitrosamines, formaldehyde, and other toxins found in petroleum-based plastics. 
Q: What type of coffee should I use? A: Use a good quality coffee or espresso. The crema and strength will vary depending on the type used. The cup size is determined by the capsule reused (anywhere from 1.35-14oz). 
Q: What capsules are supported? A: Our solution will work in all known capsules including Espresso, Double Espresso, Gran Lungo, Coffee Mug, and Alto. 
Q: How do I clean silicone products? A: Rinse with mild detergent soap and warm water or throw them in the dishwasher.
Q: Is the filter required? A: The use of the filter is personal preference. Some find the filter is beneficial in reducing coffee particulates and others see no difference in using just the silicone cap without a filter. 
Q: The coffee capsule is getting stuck down in the machine? A: To be sure this does not occur, eject the capsule from the brewer after each brew.

This lowers the cost to brew each cup and also gives you an excellent espresso or coffee each time. In addition, you will be reducing environmental impact. Each time you reuse a capsule, you reduce the cost even more on a per-cup basis. The more you use them, the more cost-effective it is.


Features
INCLUDES: 3 food grade reusable black caps & lids, sample filters, and instructions.
SOLUTION: Brew your favorite espresso or coffee with your preferred capsule. Make many capsules in advance. This is the lowest cost and most flexible per brew solution on the market.
IT WORKS: Makes beautiful crema! Enjoy your favorite coffee drink: espresso, latte, cappuccino, and coffee. Recommended for all Vertuo brewers.

RECOMMENDATION: We strongly recommend the purchase of the Capsule Holder to hold the capsules while filling them.

Instructions
Start with an empty VertuoLine capsule and fill with your favorite coffee, tamp down.
Make sure the grind is espresso and it is a good grade of coffee. The taste is only as good as the coffee you put in the capsule.
Fill the capsule completely with coffee. The cap must rest on a solid layer of coffee to reduce the stress of being pushed down so hard
Clean off the edges of the capsule.
Clean off the edges. Place filter on top of coffee and capsule and then place cap on top of capsule. Make sure the text side is up and pressed evenly into the capsule.
Place the capsule into the VertuoLine brewer and close.
Do not force the handle. If you have any trouble closing the unit, reopen it and then try again. Brew and enjoy.

FAQ
Q: What brewers will the Cap work in?
A: This black cap can be used with all brewers. Note: This product will not work with Dolce Gusto® Brewers, Tassimo® Brewers, Keurig® Brewers, or any other brand.
Q: How many times can the Cap be reused?
A: If you are careful, it will last a long time.
Q: What is the black round thing in the picture holding the capsule?
A: It is a Capsule Holder Base sold separately. The bottom of the capsules is round which makes it hard to fill unless you have something to hold the capsule. We have made the perfect holder for these capsules and strongly recommend that you purchase one of them to help refill the capsules.
Q: What is the Cap made out of?
A: My-Cap Cap is made of polypropylene.
Q: What about BPA?
A: Our products are BPA free.
Q: What coffee grind should I use?
A: Make sure you are using a good coffee, preferably something with a bold strong taste. The grind MUST be an espresso grind. If you try and use regular coffee in the capsule it will come out weak. We recommend Illy, Starbucks, Gevalia, or LaVazza pre-ground espresso.
Q: I am getting a lot of grounds in the coffee?
A: You will get more coffee particulates in your brew using this cap. We recommend the use of our filters (sold separately) with this cap. You do not have to use the paper filters though. Some people like coffee this way. Try it.
Q: The coffee capsule is getting stuck down in the machine?
A: This will happen when the cap gets pushed down into the capsule, pushing the capsule out and thus making it hard for the machine to push it back up. We recommend that you use more coffee so that the coffee cap does not get pushed down so far.
Q: How do the holes get aligned with the puncture pins?
A: The cap is designed with alignment features that cause the cap to self align with the machine. We also caution you not to force the machine closed. If it does not feel right, open it again and then try closing it again.
Q: Can your solution do both coffee and espresso?
A: Yes. The type of brew you make is determined entirely by the capsule that you reuse. If you reuse an espresso capsule then you will brew an espresso.
Q: Do you sell reusable or disposable capsules?
A: We do not and have no plans at this time to do so.
Q: My machine will sometimes make a VERY loud noise and actually begin to vibrate when my cap is used or I see it will be very difficult to close the top although I have the plastic cover flat with the top of the capsule?
A: This can be prevented by making sure you fill the capsule up with coffee to the top.  Otherwise, the cap will tend to get pushed down into the capsule, and sometimes it will get un-level which causes the unbalance. Also, if you close the machine and it seems hard, just raise the top again and close it most of the time that is all that is required to get the puncture pins to go into the holes provided. We have some alignment mechanisms in the cap but it is still possible for the pins to come down just right and not go into the holes.

Q: How many times can the disc be reused? A: Forever
Q: Does this product contain BPA? A: This product is 100% BPA-free.
Q: What type of coffee should I use? A: You should use a finely ground coffee. For weaker coffee, grind it coarser. For stronger coffee, grind it finer. Also, make sure you use a good grade of coffee (Illy, Lavazza, Starbucks, etc.). The taste is only as good as the coffee used.
Q: Do I have to use the paper filter? A: No, using the paper filter is a matter of taste. Try it and see if you like the brew better. We think you will.
Q: What is the top seal for? A: The top seal allows you to make up reusable discs in advance and seal them until they are used. Make sure to remove the top seal before placing disc in brewers.
Q: What are the bar codes for? A: T-Discs use a bar code to control the brewer. Things like water temperature, cartridge charge (loading the disc to soak), flow rate, volume (how much water you get in the cup), and purge (final phase of the brew cycle). Each of these characteristics are different for the different types of coffee you would like to brew. We supply bar codes for various size cups of coffee.
Q: My disc is exploding, what wrong? A: If your disc is exploding then it can only be because you are using a too finely ground coffee or are packing too much coffee into the disc. I would like for you to first try to use the disc with NO coffee in the disc (no filter either).  Just run hot water through it.  If that works without it exploding, try putting a little coffee in the disc. If that does not explode, then continue putting more coffee in the disc. When the coffee starts to dwindle and not come through the disc you have probably gone too far.
Q: The reusable disc is too high? A: The reusable disc is the size of normal milk discs on the market.  All brewers should be able to handle this size disc. It is normal to experience a little resistance when closing the unit.  But, don't force it if you have to press too hard.

My-Cap 2 Baskets, Caps, & Filters For Use With Keurig Single Hole K-Cup Brewers, Reusable, Refillable

Link 
https://www.my-cap.com/products/my-cap-2-baskets-caps-filters-for-use-with-keurig-single-hole-k-cup-brewers

Price
$14.99

Description
The My-Cap basket and cap allows you to use your own coffee in your Keurig single-hole brewers. Refill them with your favorite coffee or tea and recycle them forever. You will reduce your environmental impact by not purchasing new capsules for each brew. Each time you reuse a capsule, you reduce the cost even more on a per-cup basis. The more you reuse your capsule, the cheaper they get!
These baskets and caps, compatible with the Keurig single-hole brewers, are 100% Made in the USA! You can rest assured that our product is reliable and well made. We pride ourselves on keeping as much of our production and processes within the United States to support Americans and provide jobs. 
The single-serve brewer standard approach involves the purchase of a capsule with coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc. These capsules make excellent coffee. But they each cost anywhere from $0.35 to $0.80 per cup depending on the quantity and place of purchase. If you like to drink coffee, this can add up to quite a large bill very quickly. 
We recommend that you buy a bunch of baskets and caps.  The main reason most people buy the single-serve brewers is for convenience. When you buy just one, you are forced to wash out the basket and cap each time you use it defeating the convenience of the single-serve system. If you buy many of them, then you can make up a whole box of capsules in advance and still have the convenience you originally were looking for. Just store the capsules in some airtight container to keep them fresh.
WARNING: Do not force your brewer closed when using My-Cap Baskets and Caps. You should be able to close it normally. If you feel any resistance to closing the brewer, reopen it and check for any obstruction. My-Cap is not responsible for damage to your brewer if you force it closed.
NOTE: This basket does not work with the K-Mini.

Feature
INCLUDES: 2 sets of baskets and caps, ~40 filters, 1 cleaning brush/removal tool (same tool), 1 scoop, 1 coupon for free 2.0 ring, and instructions
USE YOUR OWN COFFEE: Use the coffee you love without paying a premium for pods.
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: Save money and the environment by not using wasteful disposable pods.
WORKS WITH KEURIG SINGLE HOLE BREWERS: Our solution is designed to fit Keurig single hole models. This basket does not work with the K-mini.
SUPPORT LOCAL: This product is 100% Made in the USA!


FAQ
Q: How many times can the basket and cap be reused?
A: If you are careful with them, forever. You only need a new filter each time and if you are careful washing that out you can reuse that too.
Q: Will the cap work with any pod?
A: No. It is designed to work with our baskets or reusing a K-Cup capsule.  If you reuse a capsule, you must reuse capsules with filters in them to make coffee.  Please note that some capsules like Hot Cocoa do not have any filters in them.
Q: What is this basket and cap made of?
A: The baskets and caps are made out of polypropylene and are BPA/BPS-free.
Q: Will my brewer be damaged?
A: No. Your brewer will not be damaged. 
Q: Is the cap machine-washable?
A: Yes. It is very durable and is dishwasher-safe.
Q: How much coffee should I put in the basket?
A: Fill the basket about 3/4 of the way. Make sure you use a fine grind.
Q: What coffee grind should I use?
A: In general, very fine. The coffee used in the pods is almost an espresso grind. When you clean a pod after using it the first time, feel the coffee between your fingers. Remember that sensation - that is how the grind should feel when you grind your own coffee. Ultimately, the strength of the brew is a matter of taste, so experimenting is good. In the end, if you like it, then it is the right grind.
Q: Do I use a fresh filter each time I make a capsule?
A: Yes. You can purchase formed filters on our web-site.
Q: Will the cap work with 2.0 Brewers?
A: Yes with the included 2.0 ring coupon that you can get from My-Cap for free. The coupon is good for one 2.0 ring per customer.

Q: What capsules can I refill with the filler plate? A: You can refill reused capsules, stainless steel capsules, and any plastic capsules.

My-Cap 2 Baskets, Caps, & Filters For Use With Keurig Supreme 5 Hole K-Cup Brewers

Link:
https://www.my-cap.com/products/my-cap-2-baskets-2-caps-40-filters-for-use-with-keurig-supreme-k-cup-brewers
Price
$14.99

Description
The My-Cap basket and cap allows you to use your own coffee in your Keurig Supreme brewers. Refill them with your favorite coffee or tea and recycle them forever.  You will reduce your environmental impact by not purchasing new capsules for each brew. Each time you reuse a pod, you reduce the cost even more on a per-cup basis. The more you reuse your pods, the cheaper they get!
These baskets and caps, compatible with the Keurig Supreme Brewer, are 100% Made in the USA! You can rest assured that our product is reliable and well made. We pride ourselves on keeping as much of our production and processes within the United States to support Americans and provide jobs. 
The single-serve brewer standard approach involves the purchase of pods with coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc. These pods make excellent coffee. But they each cost anywhere from $0.35 to $0.80 per cup depending on the quantity and place of purchase. If you like to drink coffee, this can add up to quite a large bill very quickly. 
We recommend that you buy a bunch of baskets and caps.  The main reason most people buy the single-serve brewers is for convenience. When you buy just one cap, you are forced to wash out the pod and cap each time you use it defeating the convenience of the single-serve system. If you buy many caps, then you can make up a whole box of pods in advance and still have the convenience you originally were looking for. Just store the pods in some airtight container to keep them fresh.
WARNING: Do not force your brewer closed when using My-Cap Baskets and Caps. You should be able to close it normally. If you feel any resistance to closing the brewer, reopen it and make sure the basket and cap are aligned properly. It will not close unless the dot on the cap is at the 12 o'clock position. My-Cap is not responsible for damage to your brewer if you force it closed.

Features
INCLUDES: 2 sets of baskets and caps, ~40 filters, 1 cleaning brush/removal tool (same tool), 1 scoop, and instructions
USE YOUR OWN COFFEE: Use the coffee you love without paying a premium for pods.
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: Save money and the environment by not using wasteful disposable pods.
WORKS WITH KEURIG SUPREME BREWERS: Our solution is designed to fit Keurig Supreme Multi-Stream models. This cap does not work with any brewer that only punctures with one hole.
SUPPORT LOCAL: This product is 100% Made in the USA!

Instructions
Keurig® and K-Cup® are registered trademarks of Keurig Dr. Pepper, Inc. Brand names and references of machine models are made solely to indicate our product's compatibility. My-Cap and its products are not associated in any way with the above companies. 

FAQ
Q: How many times can the basket and cap be reused?
A: If you are careful with them, forever. You only need a new filter each time and if you are careful washing that out you can reuse that too.
Q: Will the cap work with any pod?
A: No. It is designed to work with our baskets or reusing a K-Cup capsule.  If you reuse a capsule, you must reuse capsules with filters in them to make coffee.  Please note that some capsules like Hot Cocoa do not have any filters in them.
Q: What is this basket and cap made of?
A: The baskets and caps are made out of polypropylene and are BPA/BPS-free.
Q: Will my brewer be damaged?
A: No. Your brewer will not be damaged. 
Q: Is the cap machine-washable?
A: Yes. It is very durable and is dishwasher-safe.
Q: How much coffee should I put in the basket?
A: Fill the basket about 3/4 of the way. Make sure you use a fine grind.
Q: What coffee grind should I use?
A: In general, very fine. The coffee used in the pods is almost an espresso grind. When you clean a pod after using it the first time, feel the coffee between your fingers. Remember that sensation - that is how the grind should feel when you grind your own coffee. Ultimately, the strength of the brew is a matter of taste, so experimenting is good. In the end, if you like it, then it is the right grind.
Q: Do I use a fresh filter each time I make a capsule?
A: Yes. You can purchase formed filters on our website.
Q: Will the cap work with 2.0 Brewers?
A: No.
Q: The Supreme brewer does not seem to close all the way?
A: Do not worry.  You may not have pressed the cap down all the way. This will not hurt the brewer.

We strongly recommend the purchase of the Capsule Holder to hold the capsules while filling them. This item is sold separately.

Instructions
Start with an empty capsule and completely fill it with coffee.
Make sure the grind is espresso and a good grade of coffee. The taste is only as good as the coffee put into the capsule.
Clean the edges of the capsule.
Center foil on top of the capsule.
To determine where to place the foil, use the alignment circle edge on the holder.
Use the end of the brush, to depress the inside edge of the foil on the capsule. Be gentle. Do not break the foil.
Press foil down around the edges. Make sure the barcode under the capsule is still showing. If needed just let the foil hang down. Place the capsule into the brewer, and close. Brew and enjoy.

FAQ
Q: What brewers will the Foils work in?
A: These foils can be used with all brewer types. Note: This product will not work with Dolce Gusto Brewers, Tassimo Brewers, Keurig Brewers, or any other brand.
Q: How many times can the Foil be reused?
A: Just once. You will need to use a new one each time.
Q: What is the black round thing in the picture holding the capsule?
A: It is a Capsule Holder Base sold separately. The bottom of the VertuoLine capsules is round which makes it hard to fill unless you have something to hold the capsule. We have made the perfect holder for these capsules and strongly recommend that you purchase one of them to help refill the capsules.
Q: What is the foil made out of?
A: My-Cap foil is made of aluminum and a high-temperature adhesive.
Q: What about BPA?
A: Our products are BPA free.
Q: What coffee grind should I use?
A: Make sure you are using a good coffee, preferably something with a bold strong taste. The grind MUST be an espresso grind. If you try and use regular coffee in the capsule it will come out weak.
Q: Can your solution do both coffee and espresso?
A: Yes. The type of brew you make is determined entirely by the capsule that you reuse. If you reuse an espresso capsule then you will brew an espresso.
Q: Do you sell reusable or disposable capsules?
A: We do not and have no plans at this time to do so.

My-Foil - 100 Adhesive Foils for Keurig K-Cup Brewers

Link 
https://www.my-cap.com/products/my-foil-100-adhesive-foils-for-keurig-k-cup-brewers

Price
$12.99

Description
The My-Cap foils allow you to reuse your K-Cup Packs. Refill them with your favorite coffee or tea and recycle them many times before they have to be thrown out. That lowers the cost to brew each cup and also give you better brews each time. In addition, you will be reducing your environmental impact (more info here). Each time you reuse a Cup, you reduce the cost even more on a per-cup basis. The more you use them, the cheaper they get!

INCLUDES: 100 adhesive foils, and instructions
USE YOUR OWN COFFEE: Use the coffee you love without paying a premium for pods.
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY: Save money and the environment by not using wasteful disposable pods.

FAQ
Q: Do I have to remove the filter from the original K-Cup?
A: Yes. Just pull it out. It comes out easily.
Q: Do I have to let the K-Cup dry?
A: No. Just clean it out and you can dry it easily with a paper towel or small cloth. This is one of the advantages of using a new filter each time. It is easier to clean, dry, and refill for the next cup of coffee.
Q: When I try this it is leaking?
A: There are a couple of reasons for leaks. In the case of this filter, it is possible for you to not make the folds right and then the coffee grounds will just leak out of the filter and into your cup of coffee. You have to make sure the edge is folded over and the bottom up. The most important part is it is held together in the K-Cup Cup by the Cap. So the filter has to be between the K-Cup Cup and the Cap. It also makes a better seal around the top so there are no leaks there.

FAQ
Q: What brewers will the Filter work in?
A: This filter can be used with compatible brewers. Note: This product will not work with Dolce Gusto® Brewers, Tassimo® Brewers, Keurig® Brewers, or any other brand.
Q: How many times can the Filter be used?
A: Just once.
Q: What is the black round thing in the picture holding the capsule?
A: It is a Capsule Holder Base sold separately. The bottom of the capsules is round which makes it hard to fill unless you have something to hold the capsule. We have made the perfect holder for these capsules and strongly recommend that you purchase one of them to help refill the capsules.
Q: What is the Filter made out of?
A: My-Cap Filter is made out of strong coffee/tea filter paper.
Q: What about BPA?
A: Our products are BPA free.
Q: What coffee grind should I use?
A: Make sure you are using a good coffee, preferably something with a bold strong taste. The grind MUST be an espresso grind. If you try and use regular coffee in the capsule it will come out weak.
